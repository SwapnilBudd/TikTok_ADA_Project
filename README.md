# TikTok_ADA_Project
At TikTok, our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy. Our employees lead with curiosity and move at the speed of culture. Combined with our company's flat structure, you'll be given dynamic opportunities to make a real impact on a rapidly expanding company and grow your career.
TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. 
TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

ASSIGNMENTS:
1. TikTok is asking for a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within the comment classification project.
   Tasks: Organize project tasks into milestones, Classify tasks using the PACE workflow, Identify relevant stakeholders.
2. Build a dataframe for the claims classification data. After the dataframe is complete, organize the claims data for the process of exploratory data analysis, and update the team on the progress and insights.
   Tasks: Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset, Examine data type of each column, Gather descriptive statistics.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the claims classification project. Use Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.
   Tasks: EDA and cleaning, Select and build visualization(s) type(Create plots to visualize variables and relationships between variables), Share your results with the TikTok team.
4. Conduct hypothesis testing on the data for the claims classification data. Investigate TikTok's user claim dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the claims classification project.
   Tasks: Explore the project data, Implement a hypothesis test, Communicate insights with stakeholders within TikTok.
5. Create a regression model for the claims classification data. Determine the type of regression model that is needed and develop one using TikTok's claim classification data.
   Tasks: Determine the correct modeling approach, Build a regression model, Finish checking model assumptions, Evaluate the model, Interpret model results and summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok.
6. Create the final machine learning model for the claims classification data which include feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
   Tasks: Model building, Model evaluation, Summarize findings for cross-departmental stakeholders within TikTok.
